# Socket io

- Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.<br/>
- All the frequently updated applications used WebSocket because it is faster than HTTP Connection. When we do not want to retain a connection for a particular amount of time or reuse the connection for transmitting data; An HTTP connection is slower than WebSockets.<br/>

- Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It consists of two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.<br/>

- Socket.IO primarily uses the WebSocket protocol with polling as a fallback option, while providing the same interface. Although it can be used simply as a wrapper for WebSockets, it provides many more features, including broadcasting to multiple sockets, storing data associated with each client, and asynchronous I/O.
