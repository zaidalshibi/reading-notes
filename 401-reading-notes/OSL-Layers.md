# OSL Layers

## Physical Layer

Layer 1 contains the infrastructure that makes communication on networks possible.
It defines the electrical, mechanical, procedural, and functional specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating physical links between network devices.

## Data Link Layer

The Data Link Layer allows nodes to communicate with each other within a local area network. The foundations of line discipline, flow control, and error control are established in this layer.

## Network Layer

The Network Layer allows nodes to connect to the Internet and send information across different networks.

## Transport Layer

The Transport Layer provides end-to-end transmission of a message by segmenting a message into multiple data packets; the layer supports connection-oriented and connection-less communication.

## Session Layer

The Session Layer initiates, maintains, and terminates connections between two end-user applications. It responds to requests from the presentation layer and issues requests to the transport layer.

## Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer formats and encrypts data.

## Application Layer

The Application Layer owns the services and functions that end-user applications need to work. It does not include the applications themselves.
